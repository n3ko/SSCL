General information
===================

Symbion Simple Class Library is a class library for C++.
It is small, fast, robust and secure. Or at least it wants to be for the 1.0
release :)

Purpose
=======

It is designed for developing daemons, it has classes for:
    * Stream handling
    * Networking
    * A Lexical Analyzer
    * List handling
    * AVLTree
    * Error handling

Stream, network and lexical analyzer classes seem to be robust and secure.
The complex data structures (AVLTree, List) are not tested well.
They also need some development to make them templates so they would be more
usable.
SSCL also has some secure string handling functions, but it lacks a String
class.

Documentation
=============

Sorry, SSCL does not have any documentation yet. Except the header files, of
course :)
If you are interested in this project, you want to use it then try to examine
some projects that use it. The only open-source project I know is the Symbion
Daemon Tool (SDT). You can find it on sourceforge.net.
